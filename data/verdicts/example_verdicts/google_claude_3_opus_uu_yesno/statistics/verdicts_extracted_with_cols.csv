I'm reminded of the beauty and fragility of life, and the incredible resilience of even the smallest creatures. I'm struck by the fact that this little bird is still learning to fly, still learning to navigate the world, and still learning to survive.\n\nAs I watch the bird struggle to find its footing, I'm filled with a sense of empathy and understanding.
